# jest-reporter-debug
Custom Jest Reporter that writes arguments sent to the `onRunStart`, `onTestResult` and `onRunComplete` methods
to `console.log` as an aide for jest reporter development.

The JSDocs on the methods should help those building a custom jest reporter too.

## Further information
This reporter was built as part of a blog post I published about [writing jest reports] (https://medium.com/@colinwren/writing-a-jest-test-reporter-cb7c123ec211)you might find it useful while building your own test reporter.
